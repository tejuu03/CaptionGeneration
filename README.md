##Title :Image Captioning System Using MobileNetV2 and LSTM

#Project Overview
This project implements an image captioning system that generates descriptive textual captions for input images. It leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units for sequential text generation.

#Existing System
Uses APIKey-based models for image captioning.

#Disadvantages:
1.Low flexibility.
2.Poor generalization.
3.Dependence on accurate object detection.

#Proposed System

1.Utilizes MobileNetV2 CNN for efficient and accurate feature extraction.

2.Integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

3.Employs RNN with LSTM for generating coherent captions.

#Advantages:

1.Accurate feature extraction.

2.Improved performance through pretrained models.

3.Enhanced scalability and generalization across varied datasets.

#System Architecture
1.User Interface: Allows users to upload images for caption generation.

2.Input Image: The uploaded image serves as input to the system.

3.Preprocessing: Image resizing, normalization, and enhancement for improved analysis.

4.Feature Extraction: MobileNetV2 extracts visual features efficiently.

5.Text Generation: LSTM networks generate natural language captions based on image features.

6.Caption Generation: Outputs descriptive text for the input image.

#Implementation Modules
1.User Interface: Web or desktop interface for image upload.

2.Image Preprocessing: Standardizes image input.

3.Feature Extraction (MobileNetV2): Extracts meaningful features using CNN.

4.Text Generation (LSTM): Produces caption text based on extracted features.
